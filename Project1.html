      <p style="text-indent: 6%;">This entire project is about an open-world game called "A Walk in the Park". This game is based on android platform. Through this game I aim to present a frame that helps people to understand the significance of game development that it otherwise not so much into account. The tools that I used for the entire development of the game includes Unity Engine, 3DSMAX, Visual Studio for Coding and SDK and JDK for porting in android.The idea of game development was initially quite intriguing when I first came across different games like GTA Vice City , GTA San Andreas, Saints Row, Rust, Need for Speed etc. But all these games were made for a higher platform than Android itself.  Games like Gangster Vegas, Spiderman, Gangster New Orleans etc. helped me to build interest to make a game for android.
