             <p>As a kid, I was mesmerized by Mario hoping over obstacles in order to save the 
                princess, as an adult I am still amazed at the 16-bit character jumping and even 
                fighting fire breathing dragons just through clicking of a button. As the gaming 
                industry evolved from bits to complex open world RPGs and games like Witcher 3 and 
                Red Dead Redemption, I find myself doe-eyed and mesmerized, only to realize, I want to be a part of this industry.</p>

             <h2>Media Lover.</h2>
             <p>Movies,Television shows are not only great form of entertainment but also gives you different perspectives in life. 
                 From Lion King(1994) to as recent as Avengers Endgame we've come a long way in terms of technology and combining it 
                 with a good story telling and character development makes it an incredible experience.Browsing through Youtube I found 
                 a channel called "Our Stupid Reactions" and in one of the video found my favourite quote "You're not teachable if you're not humble. 
                 The greatest attribute of a human being is humility. Cause every other good quality comes from being humble" - Rick Segall.   </p>

                 inter-school state level competition and 1st in inter-school city level competition and can say music is a big part of my life.
                 As someone who loves Sports I follow Cricket and Football.Lifelong fan of FC Barcelona. Avid follower of La Liga, the UEFA Champions League, 
                 and world football and also Indian national cricket team.
