      <p style="text-indent: 6%;">This project is a racing game called "The Windridge City Race". This game is for windows platform.After the development of the Android game it was time to work on something new and for most of my life as a gamer, playing games like Road Fighter,NFS Most Wanted,Burnout Paradise always fascinated me.Aterall, they were the only places where i could drive a Lambo Gallardo or a Ford Mustang. The tools that I used for the entire development of the game were Unity Engine,Visual Studio for Coding, Asset store to download assets and other websites to get some of the free assets.The AI car in the game follows a waypoint system i.e. it will follow transparent cubes to complete the race.
